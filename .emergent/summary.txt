**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack Expo (React Native) and FastAPI application that clones the core functionalities of the Baby Daybook app. The application features Google authentication, a single baby profile, and comprehensive tracking for feeding, sleep, diapers, and growth. It also includes advanced features like sleep predictions, family sharing, growth charts with percentiles, and PDF data export. A real-time start/stop timer for sleep tracking has been implemented. The project has been configured for APK generation via Expo's EAS Build service and includes a detailed guide for self-hosting.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The user requested a beautiful md file for this application on github repository, that will explain the scope of the application and also add a link to the SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE.md. The agent has acknowledged this request but has not yet started the implementation.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Agent Testing Done: N/A
    - Which testing method agent to use? NA
    - User Testing Done: N/A

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. All previously reported problems (profile creation/deletion, black screen) have been resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **(P0) Create a README.md file:** Create a well-formatted  file in the project's root directory. This file should:
      - Provide a clear and attractive overview of the Baby Daybook application's features and scope.
      - Include a link to the  for users who want to host the application themselves.
      - Potentially include screenshots or GIFs of the app in action (if possible).

**Completed work in this session**
- **Application Core:**
  - Built the full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and Expo (React Native) frontend.
  - Implemented a tab-based navigation structure (Home, Track, Stats, Profile).
- **Feature Implementation:**
  - **Authentication:** Integrated Google social login using .
  - **Profile Management:** Created screens for adding and editing a baby profile.
  - **Core Trackers:** Implemented functionality and UI for tracking feeding, sleep, diapers, and growth.
  - **Advanced Features:**
    - Added sleep prediction and smart reminders with push notifications ().
    - Implemented family sync functionality for sharing baby data.
    - Integrated growth charts with WHO percentiles and PDF export on the Stats screen.
  - **Nap Timer:** Added a Start/Stop timer for sleep tracking in  with a persistent notification using a custom  service.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - **Profile Save:** Fixed navigation after saving a baby profile and prevented duplicate entries in .
  - **Profile Deletion:** Corrected the delete functionality in the backend and profile screen.
  - **Black Screen:** Resolved the black screen issue in Expo Go by correcting a React version mismatch ( and  updated to ) in .
- **Deployment & Portability:**
  - **Deployment Blockers:** Fixed several deployment issues, including N+1 queries in the backend, an insecure listener in , and incorrect  /  configurations.
  - **APK Generation Guidance:** Created  and provided the user with detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to build an APK using Expo's EAS Build service after exporting the code to GitHub.
  - **Self-Hosting Guide:** Created a detailed  explaining how to set up and run the entire application (backend, database, frontend) on a private server (PC/NAS/home lab).
  - **Configuration:** Updated  with appropriate metadata (name, package ID, permissions) for a production build. Fixed  to ensure  files are included in the GitHub repository for easier self-hosting setup.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All issues raised by the user or discovered by agents have been addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **React Version Mismatch:** A critical issue arose from a mismatch between the React version and what  expected, causing a black screen on mobile. This was resolved by explicitly setting  and  to  in . The next agent should be cautious when adding new packages that might alter these dependencies.
- **Deployment Blockers:** The  found several critical issues (N+1 queries, insecure listeners, misconfigured environment files) that the main agent had missed. This indicates a need for more thorough checks before declaring a feature complete.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** Expo, React Native, React Navigation (Tab/Stack), , , , , , .
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, MongoDB ( for async).
-   **Authentication:** Google Social Login managed via a React Context ().
-   **State Management:** React Context API (, ).
-   **Deployment:** The user has been guided to use Expo's EAS Build for APK generation and has been provided a guide for self-hosting.
-   **Database:** MongoDB.

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** 
-   **babies:** 
-   **feeding_records:** 
-   **sleep_records:** 
-   **diaper_records:** 
-   **growth_records:** 
-   **shares:** 

**changes in tech stack**
The user inquired about switching from MongoDB to MySQL/MariaDB. The agent explained that it's possible but would require a significant rewrite of the backend database logic (). No changes have been made.

**All files of reference**
-   : New document created to guide the user on self-hosting.
-   : New file created to configure Expo's EAS Build service for APK generation.
-   : Modified to include the Start/Stop sleep timer.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Handles Google login.
-   : CRUD for baby profiles.
-   : Gets all activities for the timeline.
-   , , , : CRUD endpoints for all tracking types.
-   : Gets data for statistics and charts.
-   : Endpoints for family sharing functionality.
-   : Endpoint for sleep predictions.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The primary focus is now on documentation. The user's immediate request is to create a high-quality  file for their GitHub repository.
-   The user is non-technical and has been guided through complex topics like APK building (EAS) and self-hosting. Keep explanations simple and clear.
-   The user now understands that Emergent's Deploy provides web hosting, and a separate process (EAS Build via GitHub export) is needed for native APKs.
-   The  file has been modified to *include*  files in commits. This was a deliberate choice to simplify the self-hosting setup for the user.
-   The application code is considered stable and feature-complete based on the user's requests so far.

Of course! I'll get right on creating a beautiful and informative  file for your GitHub repository. This will give your project a professional look and make it easy for others (or your future self) to understand what the app does and how to run it.

I will now create the  file.
